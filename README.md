# WordGuess
Kinda like Hangman but using only node and CLI

In this week's assignment, you will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.

Set up:

Clone this repo
run npm install

type "node index" to run game

This has a small list of words to guess using japanese car makers.  It has the same rules as hangman.  You have 10 guesses to guess the word.  If after 10 guesses you do not make the work complete, you lose.  If you do make the word complete before 10 guesses then you win.  

After the word is guessed or you lose, the next word will pop up and continue the game.  The only thing I could think of that I did not do yet is to have validation on the key press.  Right now it only makes sure that the letter is lower case.
