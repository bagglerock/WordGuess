# WordGuess
Kinda like Hangman but using only node and CLI

In this week's assignment, you will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.

Set up:

Clone this repo
run npm install

type "node index" to run game

Rules:


- This has a small list of words to guess using japanese car makers.  
- Similar to Hangman you have 10 guesses to guess the letters. 
- If after 10 guesses you do not make the work complete, you lose.  
- If you do make the word complete before 10 guesses then you win.  
- After the word is guessed or you lose, the next word will pop up and continue the game.  


Update:  Validation has been added so only one character that is a letter can be inputted using Regex
